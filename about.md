## What is the ESMValTool?
The Earth System Model Evaluation Tool (ESMValTool) is a community
         diagnostics and performance metrics tool for the evaluation of Earth
         System Models (ESMs) that allows for routine comparison of single or
         multiple models, either against predecessor versions or against
         observations. The priority of the effort so far has been to target
         specific scientific themes focusing on selected Essential Climate
         Variables, a range of known systematic biases common to ESMs, such as
         coupled tropical climate variability, monsoons, Southern Ocean
         processes, continental dry biases and soil hydrology-climate
         interactions, as well as atmospheric CO2 budgets, tropospheric and
         stratospheric ozone, and tropospheric aerosols. The tool is being
         developed in such a way that additional analyses can easily be added.
         A set of standard recipes for each scientific topic reproduces specific
         sets of diagnostics or performance metrics that have demonstrated their
         importance in ESM evaluation in the peer-reviewed literature. The
         ESMValTool is a community effort open to both users and developers
         encouraging open exchange of diagnostic source code and evaluation
         results from the CMIP ensemble. This will facilitate and improve ESM
         evaluation beyond the state-of-the-art and aims at supporting such
         activities within the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) and
         at individual modeling centers. Ultimately, we envisage running the
         ESMValTool alongside the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) as part of
         a more routine evaluation of CMIP model simulations while utilizing
         observations available in standard formats (obs4MIPs) or provided by
         the user.</p>

## Main Features
     
* Facilitates the complex evaluation of ESMs and their simulations
          submitted to international Model Intercomparison Projects (e.g.,
          CMIP).
* Standardized model evaluation can be performed against observations,
          against other models or to compare different versions of the same
          model.
* Wide scope: includes many diagnostics and performance metrics covering
          different aspects of the Earth System (dynamics, radiation, clouds,
          carbon cycle, chemistry, aerosol, sea-ice, etc.) and their
          interactions.
* Well-established analysis: standard namelists reproduce specific sets
          of diagnostics or performance metrics that have demonstrated their
          importance in ESM evaluation in the peer-reviewed literature.
* Broad documentation: user guide (Eyring et al., 2015); SPHINX; a
          log-file is written containing all the information of a specific call
          of the main script: creation date of running the script, version
          number, analyzed data (models and observations), applied diagnostics
          and variables, and corresponding references. This helps to increase
          the traceability and reproducibility of the results.
* High flexibility: new diagnostics and more observational data can be
          easily added.
* Multi-language support: Python, NCL, R... other open-source languages
          are possible.
* CF/CMOR compliant: data from many different projects can be handled
          (CMIP, obs4mips, ana4mips, CCMI, CCMVal, AEROCOM, etc.). Routines are
          provided to CMOR-ize non-compliant data.
* Integration in modeling workflows: for EMAC, NOAA-GFDL and NEMO, can
          be easily extended.
