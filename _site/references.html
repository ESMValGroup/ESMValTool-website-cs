      <td>The Earth System Model Evaluation Tool
                (ESMValTool) is a community diagnostics and
                performance metrics tool designed to improve
                comprehensive and routine evaluation of Earth
                System Models (ESMs) participating in the Coupled
                Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP). It has
                undergone rapid development since the first release
                in 2016 and is now a well-tested tool that provides
                end-to-end provenance tracking to ensure
                reproducibility. It consists of (1) an easy-to-install,
                well documented Python package providing the core
                functionalities (ESMValCore) that performs common
                pre-processing operations and (2) a diagnostic part
                that includes tailored diagnostics and performance
                metrics for specific scientific applications. Here
                we describe large-scale diagnostics of the second
                major release of the tool that supports the
                evaluation of ESMs participating in CMIP Phase 6
                (CMIP6). ESMValTool v2.0 includes a large
                collection of diagnostics and performance metrics
                for atmospheric, oceanic, and terrestrial variables
                for the mean state, trends, and variability.
                ESMValTool v2.0 also successfully reproduces
                figures from the evaluation and projections
                chapters of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
                Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) and
                incorporates updates from targeted analysis
                packages, such as the NCAR Climate Variability
                Diagnostics Package for the evaluation of modes of
                variability the Thermodynamic Diagnostic Tool
                (TheDiaTo) to evaluate the energetics of the
                climate system, as well as parts of AutoAssess that
                contains a mix of top-down performance metrics. The
                tool has been fully integrated into the Earth
                System Grid Federation (ESGF) infrastructure at the
                Deutsches Klimarechenzentrum (DKRZ) to provide
                evaluation results from CMIP6 model simulations
                shortly after the output is published to the CMIP
                archive. A result browser has been implemented that
                enables advanced monitoring of the evaluation
                results by a broad user community at much faster
       timescales than what was possible in CMIP5.</td>

      <td>The Earth System Model Evaluation Tool (ESMValTool), a community diagnostics and performance metrics tool for evaluation and analysis of Earth system models (ESMs) is designed to facilitate a more comprehensive and rapid comparison of single or multiple models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP). The ESM results can be compared against observations or reanalysis data as well as against other models including predecessor versions of the same model. The updated and extended version 2.0 of the ESMValTool includes several new analysis scripts such as large-scale diagnostics for evaluation of ESMs as well as diagnostics for extreme events, regional model and impact evaluation. In this paper, the newly implemented climate metrics such as effective climate sensitivity (ECS) and transient climate response (TCR) as well as emergent constraints for various climate-relevant feedbacks and diagnostics for future projections from ESMs are described and illustrated with examples using results from the well-established model ensemble CMIP5. The emergent constraints implemented include constraints on ECS, snow-albedo effect, climate-carbon cycle feedback, hydrologic cycle intensification, future Indian summer monsoon precipitation, and year of disappearance of summer Arctic sea ice. The diagnostics included in ESMValTool v2.0 to analyze future climate projections from ESMs further include analysis scripts to reproduce selected figures of chapter 12 of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) Fifth Assessment report (AR5) and various multi-model statistics.</td>

<td>This paper describes the second major release of the Earth System Model Evaluation Tool (ESMValTool), a community diagnostic and performance metrics tool for the evaluation of Earth system models (ESMs) participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP). Compared to version 1.0, released in 2016, ESMValTool version 2.0 (v2.0) features a brand new design, with an improved interface and a revised preprocessor. It also features a significantly enhanced diagnostic part that is described in three companion papers. The new version of ESMValTool has been specifically developed to target the increased data volume of CMIP Phase 6 (CMIP6) and the related challenges posed by the analysis and the evaluation of output from multiple high-resolution or complex ESMs. The new version takes advantage of state-of-the-art computational libraries and methods to deploy an efficient and user-friendly data processing. Common operations on the input data (such as regridding or computation of multi-model statistics) are centralized in a highly optimized preprocessor, which allows applying a series of preprocessing functions before diagnostics scripts are applied for in-depth scientific analysis of the model output. Performance tests conducted on a set of standard diagnostics show that the new version is faster than its predecessor by about a factor of 3. The performance can be further improved, up to a factor of more than 30, when the newly introduced task-based parallelization options are used, which enable the efficient exploitation of much larger computing infrastructures. ESMValTool v2.0 also includes a revised and simplified installation procedure, the setting of user-configurable options based on modern language formats, and high code quality standards following the best practices for software development.</td>

       <td>This paper complements a series of now four publications that document the release of the Earth System Model Evaluation Tool (ESMValTool) v2.0. It describes new diagnostics on the hydrological cycle, extreme events, impact assessment, regional evaluations, and ensemble member selection. The diagnostics are developed by a large community of scientists aiming to facilitate the evaluation and comparison of Earth system models (ESMs) which are participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP). The second release of this tool aims to support the evaluation of ESMs participating in CMIP Phase 6 (CMIP6). Furthermore, datasets from other models and observations can be analysed. The diagnostics for the hydrological cycle include several precipitation and drought indices, as well as hydroclimatic intensity and indices from the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI). The latter are also used for identification of extreme events, for impact assessment, and to project and characterize the risks and impacts of climate change for natural and socio-economic systems. Further impact assessment diagnostics are included to compute daily temperature ranges and capacity factors for wind and solar energy generation. Regional scales can be analysed with new diagnostics implemented for selected regions and stochastic downscaling. ESMValTool v2.0 also includes diagnostics to analyse large multi-model ensembles including grouping and selecting ensemble members by user-specified criteria. Here, we present examples for their capabilities based on the well-established CMIP Phase 5 (CMIP5) dataset.</td>
